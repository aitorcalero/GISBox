# GISBox

Project to create a **file synchronization service between an [ArcGIS Online](http://doc.arcgis.com/es/arcgis-online/reference/what-is-agol.htm) or [ArcGIS Enterprise](http://server.arcgis.com/es/server/latest/get-started/windows/what-is-arcgis-enterprise-.htm) account and a local-based filesystem**. 

With this tool you can easily synchronize all the content you have in your ArcGIS Organization to a local folder. This way you can easily manage documents, CSVs files, Shapefiles, etc... as you would do with other tools like [BOX](https://www.box.com), [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com) or [OneDrive](https://www.onedrive.com).

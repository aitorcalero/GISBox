# GISBox

Project to create a **file synchronization service between an [ArcGIS Online](http://doc.arcgis.com/es/arcgis-online/reference/what-is-agol.htm) or [ArcGIS Enterprise](http://server.arcgis.com/es/server/latest/get-started/windows/what-is-arcgis-enterprise-.htm) account and a local-based filesystem**. 

With this tool you can easily synchronize all the content you have in your ArcGIS Organization to a local folder. This way you can easily manage documents, CSVs files, Shapefiles, etc... as you would do with other tools like [BOX](https://www.box.com), [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com) or [OneDrive](https://www.onedrive.com). 

This project uses the [ArcGIS API for Python](https://developers.arcgis.com/python/): 

> a Python library for working with maps and geospatial data. It provides simple and efficient tools for sophisticated vector and raster analysis, geocoding, map making, routing and directions, as well as for organizing and managing a GIS with users, groups and information items.
